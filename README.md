# M.A.A.S. - Modular Architectural Assemblage System
## Introduction
The escalating global challenges of climate change, extreme events, wars, and other crises are compelling millions of people to seek new homes each year. Often, those displaced are housed in temporary facilities with limited opportunities to personalize their living spaces. The reality of "climate nomads" necessitates readily deployable architectural solutions, particularly easily assembled housing systems that offer flexible spatial configurations and incorporate essential architectural features. The MAAS project addresses this urgent need by exploring the design of such adaptable, low-to-mid-density housing systems that leverage the benefits of modularity.

## Fostering Communities
MAAS recognizes that relocation efforts should extend beyond providing mere shelter. It aims to empower individuals to participate in the design and construction of their spaces, thereby fostering a sense of belonging and facilitating community growth through social interaction. The core idea is to develop a system that ensures a minimum constructive quality while being simple to build, potentially even self-constructed. This empowers users to articulate and customize spaces and their relationships, which are fundamental to building communities. While initially conceived for emergency contexts, the modularity and adaptability of MAAS open up a range of other potential applications, including off-grid living and exhibition pavilions, and could even inspire unforeseen uses.
