# M.A.A.S. - Modular Architectural Assemblage System

> *With humanitarian aid in decline, the international community must shift its focus from short-term relief efforts to inclusive policies that support both refugees and host communities.* [United Nations, 25 April 2025](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1162631)

## Introduction
The escalating global challenges of **climate change, extreme events, wars, and other crises** are compelling millions of people to seek new homes each year. Often, those displaced are housed in temporary facilities with limited opportunities to personalize their living spaces. The reality of "climate nomads" necessitates readily deployable architectural solutions, particularly **easily assembled housing** systems that offer **flexible spatial configurations** and incorporate essential architectural features. The MAAS project addresses this urgent need by exploring the design of such adaptable, low-to-mid-density housing systems that leverage the benefits of modularity.

## Fostering Communities
MAAS recognizes that relocation efforts should extend beyond providing mere shelter. It aims to **empower individuals to participate in the design and construction of their spaces**, thereby fostering a **sense of belonging and facilitating community growth through social interaction**. The core idea is to develop a system that ensures a **minimum constructive quality** while being **simple to build, potentially even self-constructed**. This empowers users to articulate and customize spaces and their relationships, which are fundamental to building communities. While initially conceived for emergency contexts, the **modularity and adaptability** of MAAS open up a range of other potential applications, including **off-grid living** and exhibition pavilions, and could even inspire unforeseen uses.

## The MAAS research project
The MAAS project aims to **design and prototype modular wooden structures at a 1:1 scale as a proof of concept**. These structures are conceived as kits comprising parts and assembly instructions that can be **easily assembled by users** in diverse configurations through an open-ended process. The project focuses on developing different building 'kits' such as 'structure', 'floor', 'wall', 'rooftop', 'patio', 'louvers', and 'canopy'. These will be designed as **modular elements**, granting users the freedom to arrange them according to their needs. Each kit will provide the essential materials and **"IKEA style" building instructions**. Importantly, certain elements such as **insulation, interior and exterior finishes, doors, and windows will be optional, encouraging the use and reuse of local materials and enabling building customization**. Similar to Lego bricks, the kits are predefined, but the potential assembly outcomes and applications are virtually limitless.

## Kit Design Principles
The design of the MAAS kits will adhere to some key guidelines:
- **DIY (Do-It-Yourself)**: Each kit must be easily mounted by anyone, including the final users, thanks to clear instructions. 
- **Minimize Standard Parts**: The design will minimize the typologies of standard wood elements and metal parts/connections. 
- **Low-Tech Assembly**: Recognizing that energy supply may be unreliable, the design prioritizes low-tech tools and easy assembly methods. 
- **Digital Fabrication (kit parts)**: precision facilitates assembly so digital manufacturing can be implemented in making the parts. 
- **Custom Tools for assembly**: The project will consider the design and digital fabrication of custom tools to simplify the assembly process. 
- **Open-Source Instructions and Database**: Assembly instructions will be designed and shared as a database using an open-source approach. 
- **Design for Disassembly**: The design will also consider the possibility of disassembly. Materials can potentially be recovered, reused, or repurposed later. 
- **Configurational Variety**: Each kit and its modularity should allow for different potential final configurations to enhance variety. 
- **Modular Design for Adaptability**: Modular design is central to facilitating repair and transformations over time. 
- **Off-Grid Capabilities**: The design will favor energy and water independence to promote self-sufficiency and the conscious use of local resources.

## Assemblage
While the kits define the components of the system, **the arrangement, quantity, and placement of these kits will be determined by the needs of the inhabitants and their desired interactions and shared spaces**. The system is intentionally designed to foster the development of **"third places" – spaces for informal and free social interaction – which are vital for community development**. The inherent **modularity** of the parts also allows for **transformations of the assemblage over time**, enabling adaptation to changing conditions and facilitating maintenance or replacements.

## Goals
The primary goals of this research project are to **design, prototype, and develop a database of modular element kits and their assembly instructions**. This valuable resource will be shared as **open-source material**, allowing end-users to **utilize and customize it based on local materials, context, and economic resources**. The platform will be designed to accommodate the addition of **further modular components or locally customized ones** at any time, thereby expanding the possibilities for assembled configurations in a community-driven manner.

## Open Research Project
MAAS is conceived as an open research project, with the understanding that its development could take diverse directions depending on the specific aspects investigated, the materials chosen, the available machinery and facilities, and emerging research opportunities. As an independent research group, the team is **open to collaborations and actively seeking research funding opportunities**. Furthermore, they are **available for mentoring workshops and seminars** in both academic and non-academic settings.

## Research Project Team
- Andrea Graziano - architect & computational designer - Co-de-iT
- Tommaso Venturini - architect/engineer - rammed earth specialist
- Marco Palma - computational designer - TUWien & Co-de-iT

## Possible Workshops and Seminars
A series of workshops/seminars could be proposed as a practical way to engage with the MAAS project. These workshops would offer a **design and hands-on experience** for 12-15 participants, divided into groups focusing on both the **design of kit components and the prototyping of different kit sets**. The workshop structure would emphasize **a feedback loop between the digital modeling of kit parts and their assemblage strategies, and physical prototyping** to test these ideas in reality.

### Topics
Participants in the workshops will dig into various relevant topics:
- Modularity and spatial articulation
- Assemblage thinking
- Wood and metal joinery
- Wood frame construction methods
- Material usage optimization
- Reuse of elements from dismantled buildings or processes
- Energy and water collection

### Required Skills and Tools
Basic **3D modeling and basic fabrication skills** are required for participation in the workshops. The primary software tools will be **Rhino 3d & Grasshopper**, although other 3D modeling tools could also be used. **Wood and metalworking tools will be provided on-site**, while digital fabrication tools such as **3D printers, CNC routers, and robots**, if available, could be utilized.
